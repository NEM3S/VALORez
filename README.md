#           VALORez
Software that truly stretches VALORANT
## Presentation
This is my first repositories on GitHub, my biggest python project and my first time using **flet**.
## Introduction
The aim of this software is to convert VALORANT to True Stretched Resolution very quickly and easily.
There is already a method for doing this, but it takes much more time, using the WinExplorer software.
## Features
You can stretch VALORANT in any resolution (existing or customised).
## Setup
### Before you start
* You must have **Python** v3.10+ installed _(You can have some issues with Microsoft Store version)_, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* You must install **requirements** by opening a command prompt in the **source** directory and running this command line :<br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 1
- Run the **gui.pyw** file in the **source** directory and an application should be appear.
### Step 2
- Now in the app, click on the `üìÅ` button and find ***RiotClientServices.exe***.<br>
- Then click on the `Patch & Start VALORANT` button, if it worked, the path of ***RiotClientServices.exe*** will be saved and a message should appear saying : *Done!*<br><sup>Moreover, *Done!* can appear but VALORANT didn't start, don't worry, it's been patched anyway and all you have to do is to click on the `Start` button in Riot Client.</sup>
### Step 3
- Once the game has started, you can select your desired resolution in the `Dropdown` list.
### Step 4
- Hit the `‚úîÔ∏è` button to confirm your resolution and apply stretch, your resolution will be saved and a message should appear saying : *VALORANT in now stretched!*.<br>
<sup>If window styles aren't applied, remove the docstrings quotes in the **gui.pyw** to request admin privileges.</sup>
### Optional Steps
- If you click on the `üñ•Ô∏è` button, it will set your resolution to default (your computer's highest resolution, which should be the default one).
- If you click on the `üóëÔ∏è` button, it will clear the selection the dropdown list.
- Finally, you can close the application by clicking on the `Close` button.

## Enjoy!
